# Homework 16 - More Arrays; for loops

Create an Eclipse project named `hw16-more-arrays`.

Copy the live code from lecture here into your project:
- [Lecture code files](./live/)

## Tasks 

1. Complete the `getLow()` and `getAverage()` methods in `SeqDailyRecord`. For your own benefit, try to write these from scratch, without looking at the `getHigh()` method. Use `for` loops.

2. Rewrite `while` loops in `BasicDailyRecord` to use `for` instead.

3. Make the code in both `SeqDailyRecord` and `BasicDailyRecord` as "bulletproof" as possible. Write additional test cases of your own in a separate test method of the `DailyRecordTest` class that fail for the `BasicDailyRecord` as it currently stands.

    You may assume that the coldest possible valid temperature value is -460 (absolute zero, Fahrenheit), and, reasonably speaking, the warmest possible valid temperature value is 1000 (warmest temperature on Mercury is 800 degrees Fahrenheit).
