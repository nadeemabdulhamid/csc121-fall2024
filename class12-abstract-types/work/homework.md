# Homework 12 - Abstracting Types (Generics)

Create an Eclipse project named `hw12-generics`.

## Task: Abstracting Types: min() on Lists

Add the four [files from lecture](../live/) to your project. Abstract over the [ILoA](../code/ILoA.java) and [ILoB](../code/ILoB.java) classes to define a generic `min()` method (with its accumulator-style helper method) in the `ILoX` set of classes.
