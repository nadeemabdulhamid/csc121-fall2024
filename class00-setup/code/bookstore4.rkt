;; A Book is (make-book String Author Num Symbol)
;; There are three kinds of books: fiction, nonfiction, textbook
;; represented by symbols 'F 'N 'T
(define-struct book (title author price kind))

;; An Author is (make-author String Num)
(define-struct author (name yob))

;; Examples of authors
(define eh (make-author "Hemingway" 1900))
(define ebw (make-author "White" 1920))
(define mf (make-author "MF" 1970))

;; Examples of books
(define oms (make-book "Old Man and the Sea" eh 10 'F))
(define eos (make-book "Elements of Style" ebw 20 'N))
(define htdp (make-book "HtDP" mf 60 'T))

 the sale price of the book depends on the daily discounts
 these may differ depending on the kind of book
 suppose today we have the folloiwng discounts:
 there is 30% discount on fiction books
 there is 20% discount on nonfiction books
 textbooks sell at full price
|#

;; book-sale-price: Book -> Number
;; compute the sale prices of the given book based on today's discounts
(check-expect (book-sale-price oms) 7)
(check-expect (book-sale-price eos) 16)
(check-expect (book-sale-price htdp) 60)

(define (book-sale-price abook)
  (cond
    [(symbol=? (book-kind abook) 'F) (- (book-price abook) (* 0.3 (book-price abook)))]
    [(symbol=? (book-kind abook) 'N) (- (book-price abook) (* 0.2 (book-price abook)))]
    [(symbol=? (book-kind abook) 'T) (book-price abook)]))

 Now design a function for Books that determines whether
 the author of a Book was born before 1950.
|#

;; before1950?: Book -> Boolean
;; was the author of the book born before 1950?
(check-expect (before1950? oms) true)
(check-expect (before1950? eos) true)
(check-expect (before1950? htdp) false)

(define (before1950? abook)
  (author-before1950? (book-author abook)))

;; author-before1950?: Author -> Boolean
;; was this author born before 1950?
(check-expect (author-before1950? eh) true)
(check-expect (author-before1950? ebw) true)
(check-expect (author-before1950? mf) false)

(define (author-before1950? an-author)
  (< (author-yob  an-author) 1950))

#|
 Now suppose we have a list of Books and we want a list
 of only the Books with authors born before 1950.
|#

;; We can use the abstract function filter and the function we
;; we wrote above to produce only select items from a given list

;; FILTER DEFINITION:
;; filter: (X -> Boolean) [Listof X] -> [Listof X]
;; to construct a list from all those items on 'alox' for which 'P' holds
;; (define (filter P alox) ...)


;; all-books-before1950: [Listof Book] -> [Listof Book]
;; produce from the given list a list of all books written
;; by authors born before 1950
(check-expect (all-books-before1950 empty) 
              empty)
(check-expect (all-books-before1950 (list oms htdp eos))
              (list oms eos))
(check-expect (all-books-before1950 (list oms eos)) 
              (list oms eos))
(check-expect (all-books-before1950 (list htdp)) 
              empty)

(define (all-books-before1950 alob)
  (filter before1950? alob))

#|
 Compute the total sale price of all books in a given list
 that are on sale today.
|#

;; total-sale-price: [Listof Book] -> Number
;; compute the total sale price of all books in the given list
(check-expect (total-sale-price empty) 0)
(check-expect (total-sale-price (list oms htdp eos)) 83)
(check-expect (total-sale-price (list oms eos)) 23)
(check-expect (total-sale-price (list htdp)) 60)

;; IDEA:
;; we can produce a list of all sale prices and then add all items in the list

(define (total-sale-price alob)
  (foldr + 0 (map book-sale-price alob)))

;... can we do this better? ... to add the prices as we go?
(total-sale-price (list oms htdp eos))
