# Homework 9 - Methods for Self-referential Data

Create an Eclipse project named `hw09-self-ref-methods`.

## Project Milestone

Work on Part 2 of [Creative Project - Milestone 1](https://berry.instructure.com/courses/13058/assignments/208200) for Wednesday.


## Part 1: Methods for Books - due Monday

Start with the code files here representing a list of books in a bookstore:

- [Book, BookTest, and ILoB](../code/)

Add `equals()`/`hashCode()` and `toString()` methods to the `ILoB` hierarchy of classes. Make sure you add them to the `Book` and `Author` classes as well. 

Add the following methods to the `ILoB` hierarchy of classes. There are some test cases already in the BookTest class -- uncomment them as you go.

```
  // computes the total sale price of all books in *this* list
  public int totalPrice();
  
  // sort *this* list of books by sale price
  public ILoB sortByPrice();
  
  // insert a book into this list, sorted by sale price
  public ILoB insertByPrice(Book b);
  
  // select from this list those books written by the given author
  public ILoB selectByAuthor(Author a);
  
  // produce the book with cheapest sale price in this list
  public Book cheapestBook();
  /* in the MTLoB case, raise an error using this statement 
     instead of a return:
         throw new RuntimeException("The list is empty!");
  */
  
  // produce the book with cheapest sale price in this list; given the
  // cheapest book seen so far in the list (accumulator-style method)
  public Book cheapestBookAcc(Book cheapest);
```



## Part 2: Methods for Mobiles - due Wednesday

Download the following files for mobiles and add them to your project. Follow the steps below to finish designing the four methods that are currently commented out in the `IMobile` interface definition. Make sure you add `equals()` and `toString()` methods to the classes.

> [IMobile, Simple, Complex, IMobileTest](../code/)

- Study the data definitions and examples, then **fill in the templates** for the classes `Simple` and `Complex`.

- Design the method `totalWeight` that computes the total weight of a mobile. Suppose for simplicity that that only thing that contributes to the weight of the mobile are the weights at the end of the simple hanging items. I have already include a set of examples at the bottom of the file; uncomment it and study it to understand how the method should be designed.

- We would like to hang the mobile in a room and want to figure out how far down below the ceiling it will hang. Design the method `height` that computes the height of the mobile. Note that the height of the `complex2` example is 60 (do you understand how that is?).

- Design a function to compute the `torque` on a mobile. Loosely speaking, `torque` is a measure of the turning force on an object. Suppose the torque is given by the formula:

      torque = (total right hand weight * right hand distance) - 
            (total left hand weight * left hand distance )

  Note: Torque is not recursive. If a mobile has a submobile, the torque does not need to know the submobile's torques, just the weight of the whole submobile. Think about the fact that the whole submobile's weight is suspended by a thin string from a single point on the higher mobile, thus the subtorques don't matter because all the weight of the submobile is exerted on one point, so it might as well just be a weight.

- Design a method to determine if a mobile is balanced. Let's say a mobile is balanced if:

  - The mobile's torque is zero.
  - Its left submobile is balanced.
  - Its right submobile is balanced.

  Note that simple weights are always balanced for the purposes of this calculation.
